# Composer Mac Security Demonstration

This example "library" demonstrates one of the abilities we implicitly grant [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
when we run an install locally.  For demonstration purposes, I've made this a local demo
for a Mac.  It will execute the `say` command to demonstrate it can execute things you didn't 
necessarily authorize.

There is a companion piece with this located at [aaronsaray.com/blog](https://www.aaronsaray.com/2019/composer-security-concerns-create-project).
